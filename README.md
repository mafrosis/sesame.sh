Sesame.sh
=========

A pure bash implementation of Sesame encrypt/decrypt tool, [originally developed](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/sesame) in Python.

Sesame provides a tar-like interface to encrypt & decrypt one or more files and directories, primarily to enable sensitive configuration files to be included in source control.

Sesame was inspired by a [blog post](http://ejohn.org/blog/keeping-passwords-in-source-control) by [@jeresig](https://twitter.com/jeresig).
